# Name and Summary
## Project Name :
- An Analysis of the Relationship between Global PM2.5 Levels, GDP, and Population.

## Summary :
- We use Python to generate a bar chart race of accumulated PM2.5 in each country from 1980 to 2022. By taking reference of this data, the United Nations and NASA can enact international conventions to regulate PM2.5 emissions, which is important because the particles are smaller than a hair grain so that they can pass through the alveoli and circulate the human body via blood flow. The impact of PM2.5 on physical health and ecology systems is nontrivial.

- The Significance of NASA Data in Our Study.
    - Utilizing the NASA PM2.5 database as a foundation and supplementing it with global population and GDP data variables, we analyze whether PM2.5 is positively correlated with these dependent variables. It is widely acknowledged that economic development and population size are crucial factors in a nation's progress. We aim to contribute to global environmental improvement through a data-driven analytical approach, offering tailored reference indicators to nations for fostering positive development.

- What is PM2.5?
    - There are many polutions in the air, one of them is dust-like, granular substances known as particular matters (PM). PMs differ in diameters; for those smaller than 2.5 micrometers (μm) are known as PM2.5, which is measured in μg/m3.


## Use of Artificial Intelligence
- we used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to write code, translate and generate technical documentation.
